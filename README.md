## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/projects/dotfiles`, with `~/dotfiles` as a symlink.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slariviere/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```
